## Principle

BlackDex unpacks APK File by DexFile cookie. In theory, it supports all version Android systems that use ART (Android Runtime). But it may vary from a few special devices. We do not have enough resources to execute a lot of testing, if you have problems with this project, please open an issue on the GitHub.

## Deep Unpacking

BlackDex will fix the DexCode in deep unpacking mode, it can load DexCode which were pointed to other Memory Blocks into DexFile. By this way, we can restore some methods which were erased with NOP. But it can not fix all methods. For example, some applications restore the instructions just before being executed. In this situation, BlackDex can not restore the instructions into DexFile. Deep Unpacking dose not include operation of decryption and executing methods. This feature was still in the test phase, **it is possible that following cases will occur, may the NOP has no longer exists in this world!**

1.BlackDex will take more time to unpack an app, it expected to take a few minutes or more.

2.The target application is possible to crash when BlackDex is unpacking it(Environment detection, etc).

3.The failure rate of unpacking will be increased.

4.It may not always fix all methods successfully.
